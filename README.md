# Billy Bessas – Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio. This is a growing collection of hands-on labs and technical projects across two domains:

- **Cybersecurity**: PCAP analysis, malware investigation, SIEM workflows, and incident response  
- **IT Support**: Troubleshooting, Windows endpoint hardening, user support scenarios, and ticket simulation

Each project is designed to reflect my progress as a career switcher entering the cybersecurity and IT support fields. Labs are fully documented with Markdown reports, annotated screenshots, and demo walkthroughs when applicable.
