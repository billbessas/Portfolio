# cybersecurity-portfolio

This is a growing collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs and projects showcasing my skills in network traffic analysis, digital forensics, and incident response. Each project includes documentation, analysis, and demo videos to reflect my progress as I transition into a cybersecurity career. 

The first project features a packet capture investigation from the CyberDefenders **WebStrike** scenario, using **Wireshark** to identify and interpret malicious activity. More projects and tools—including Splunk, SIEM platforms, and threat detection use cases—will be added as I continue working through the CyberDefenders SOC Analyst track.
