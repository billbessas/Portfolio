## Lab Scenario

A suspicious file was discovered on a company web server. The Development team flagged the anomaly, and a PCAP file of the relevant network traffic was captured. Your task: trace the attacker's activity, understand how the file was uploaded, and determine what (if anything) was exfiltrated.


## Tools Used

- ** Wireshark** (for full traffic analysis)
- IP Geolocation services
- PCAP file provided via Cyber Defenders
- Markdown and screenshots for documentation
